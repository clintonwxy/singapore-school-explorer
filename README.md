# Group_unknwon_Visualising_Singapore
Group Repository for QMSS Data Visualization Final Project

## Brief Description

We will be looking at the education landscape in Singapore, focusing on educational (in)equality. Some questions we are looking at include:
(1) Indicators of "quality" - how due perceptions of a school's quality (e.g. on forums, as indicated through entry cut-off grades) compare to actual indicators (e.g. passing rates on national exams)
(2) How do these correlate with spatial inequality - in Singapore, priority enrollment in primary schools (elementary schools) are given to those living within 1km radius. Do wealthy areas tend to correlate with where "quality" schools are located?
(3) How do the flows of resources correlate with education quality. E.g. do higher quality schools tend to have the same pool of principals / teachers, offer the same types of extracurriculars, etc.
