We put the child at the heart of all we do and believe we can make a difference in our students' lives.  The Yuan Ching Education leverages strong partnership among educators, parents, alumni and the community to nurture the whole child to realise his full potential. Our student is equipped with strong fundamentals and skills to thrive in a globalised, technology-driven world. He is a critical thinker, reflective learner and team player. He learns to be caring and responsible to his family and community; he understands and plays his role in contributing to the future of Singapore.  Resilient and diligent, our student exemplifies the school's motto of 'Efforts Today, Rewards Tomorrow'. Our community is inclusive and welcoming. Our teachers care deeply for their students and will give their utmost support and guidance to their students. It is a safe, nurturing home for our students, grounded in positive discipline, care and concern that values every individual. Riding on the legacy of resilience, resourcefulness and responsibility by our pioneers, the school spirit inspires staff and students to live these virtues and to build a strong school identity and affiliation. It affirms individual strengths and spurs every student to explore new paths and strive for excellence.  It energizes collective efforts and moves teams towards success beyond expectations.  Our environment is vibrant and provides opportunities for individuals to pursue their interests and achieve peaks of excellence. Students are empowered to lead, serve and inspire their peers. Our students embody our core values of IExCEL (Integrity, Excellence, Compassion, Enterprise and Loyalty). They are creative, motivated, humble and respectful. They make a difference in the community and beyond, and grow to epitomise our vision of 'A Thinker, an Achiever and Concerned Citizen'.",
