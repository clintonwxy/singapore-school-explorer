		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school offers a variety of programmes to widen the students' learning experiences for greater development in cognitive, social-moral, leadership, physical and aesthetic domains. The school's distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Aerospace, together with many related partners, provides our students an edge when applying for aerospace-related courses which in turn opens a career pathway for them in the rapidly growing aerospace industry. All Lower Secondary students are equipped with basic knowledge in aerospace topics and essential STEM skills. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Outdoor Education which is known as A.C.E (Adventure-Character-Environment) aims to develop character, inculcate values of grit and resilience and build leadership traits in all students, as they learn adventure skills such as orienteering as well as cultivate an appreciation for the environment. Students who excel at the various adventure skills may have the opportunity to participate in various competitions. In addition, the Stained Glass Art Programme empowers the students to express their creativity and develop their spirit of innovation. As the making of stained glass artwork requires skill and patience, students working in teams will develop fortitude while learning to value each other's strengths. Northbrooks offers a range of Values-in-Action opportunities for all students.  All students take part in Recyclatron, an annual recycling activity which allows students to spread the message of recycling.  The Secondary Two students undergo a learning journey to VWOs to learn the fundamentals of Service Learning.  This culminates in the Secondary Three student-initiated service learning project. The Whole-School Approach to Effective Communication (WSA-EC) aims to build students' competencies in communicating in English by raising students' interest and motivation in reading and speaking good English through specific learning activities."
