The Canossian education emulates the work and spirit of our foundress St Magdalene of Canossa to serve the poorest of the poor. It is inclusive and embraces persons of all faiths and races and those with special needs. The Canossian education emphasizes on the formation of the heart to anchor our pupils in values especially to instil in our pupils the spirit of serving the poor.",

CCPS graduands will be leaders of character who live the Canossian Identity which encompasses the school values of 3Cs (Commitment, Compassion and Cheerfulness). ",
